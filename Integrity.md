I pledge, as a member of the Australian National University community, to abide
by and uphold the standards of academic integrity outlined in the ANU statement
on [honesty and plagiarism](http://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/assessments-exams/academic-honesty-plagiarism),
and I am aware of the relevant [legislation](http://www.anu.edu.au/about/governance/legislation/academic-misconduct-rule-2015),
and understand the consequences of me breaching those rules.
